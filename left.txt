2. CRUD Operations
Several pages have "Add" and "Edit" buttons but functionality is incomplete:

⚠️ Orders: Create/Edit order functionality needs backend integration
⚠️ Shipments: Create shipment functionality needs completion
⚠️ Inventory: Add/Edit inventory items needs backend integration
⚠️ Warehouses: Add/Edit warehouse needs backend integration
⚠️ Carriers: Edit carrier functionality needs completion
⚠️ SLA Policies: Create/Edit SLA policies needs backend integration
⚠️ Returns: Process return functionality needs completion
3. Settings Page Functionality
⚠️ Profile settings (name, email, company) - needs backend API
⚠️ Password change - needs backend API
⚠️ Email notifications toggle - needs backend API
⚠️ Two-factor authentication - needs full implementation
⚠️ Active sessions management - needs backend API
4. User Management
⚠️ Multi-user support (currently only admin user exists)
⚠️ Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Viewer roles)
⚠️ User invitation system
⚠️ Permission management
5. Real-time Features
⚠️ Live shipment tracking updates
⚠️ Real-time notifications (currently just mock data)
⚠️ WebSocket integration for live updates
6. Data Validation & Error Handling
⚠️ Form validation needs enhancement (currently basic)
⚠️ Better error messages for API failures
⚠️ Loading states consistency across all pages
⚠️ Toast notifications for success/error actions
7. Testing
⚠️ Unit tests for components
⚠️ Integration tests for API endpoints
⚠️ E2E tests for critical user flows
8. Performance Optimization
⚠️ Implement pagination for large datasets (currently loads all data)
⚠️ Add data caching strategy
⚠️ Optimize re-renders (React.memo where needed)
⚠️ Code splitting for better initial load time
9. Security Enhancements
⚠️ JWT token refresh mechanism
⚠️ Rate limiting on API endpoints
⚠️ Input sanitization
⚠️ CORS configuration for production
⚠️ Environment variables security
10. Database Schema Enhancements
Current database has these tables but needs more relationships:

11. Additional Features
⚠️ Export data to CSV/Excel
⚠️ Print shipping labels
⚠️ Barcode/QR code generation
⚠️ Advanced search/filtering across all pages
⚠️ Bulk operations (bulk update, bulk delete)
⚠️ Dashboard customization (drag-drop widgets)
⚠️ Report generation (PDF reports)
12. Mobile Responsiveness
⚠️ Test and optimize for mobile devices
⚠️ Mobile-specific navigation
⚠️ Touch-friendly interactions
13. Deployment
⚠️ Production build configuration
⚠️ Docker containerization
⚠️ CI/CD pipeline setup
⚠️ Database migration scripts
⚠️ Environment-specific configurations

Phase 3: Real-time & Notifications (Medium Priority)
Add WebSocket support for live updates
Implement real notification system
Add real-time tracking updates
Phase 4: Performance & Security (High Priority)
Add proper pagination for large datasets
Implement JWT refresh tokens
Add rate limiting and security headers
Input sanitization and validation
Phase 5: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
Export/Import functionality
Report generation
Advanced analytics
Mobile app (if needed)
📊 Current Project Status
Frontend: ~90% complete (UI/UX done, needs backend integration)
Backend: ~60% complete (basic CRUD done, needs enhancement)
Dark Mode: ✅ 100% complete
Authentication: ✅ 95% complete (needs session management)
Database: ✅ 80% complete (schema good, needs more data & relationships)
Documentation: ✅ 85% complete
Overall Project Completion: ~75%

The foundation is solid, and the application is fully functional for demo purposes. The main focus now should be completing backend APIs and adding production-ready features like proper validation, security, and user management.
